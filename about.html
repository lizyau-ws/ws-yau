            <h2>Hey there! I'm Liz Yau, <br> an UX student at De Haagse Hogeschool </h2><br>
            <img src="img/IMG-36792.jpg" style=width:45%> <br>
            <p> I have always believe in the power of design which exists at all levels of our society:
                from architecture to data visualization, from bio-design to urban planning, from advertising to every
                single product.
                Design has an inherent restorative ability and we, as designers, can bring concepts and objects into the
                existence that can
                carry different messages and raise awareness towards certain issue, or even to strengthen the weakening
                bonds between people and social environments. </p><br>
            <p> Before my UX program in The, my major was Print Media in Hong Kong Design Institute. Even though people
                would consider it as less important nowadays,
                my study journey there makes me truly realize and has built up my awareness that,
                it doesn't matter of which design field it is or how tiny of each decision we need to making in the
                process,
                every tiny bit of it can already create different consequences and impression for the user. </p><br>
            <p>All these different experience has lead me to where I am at at this moment, to develop user-friendly and
                communicative experiences and services
                to create value for enterprises, society and individual users. </p>
